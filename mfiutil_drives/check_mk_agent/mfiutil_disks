# NOTE: This agent has beed adapted from the Check_MK linux agent.
#       The most sections are commented out at the moment because
#       they have not been ported yet. We will try to adapt most
#       sections to print out the same output as the linux agent so
#       that the current checks can be used.

# This might be a good source as description of sysctl output:
# http://people.freebsd.org/~hmp/utilities/satbl/_sysctl.html

# Remove locale settings to eliminate localized outputs where possible
